    <h2 class="h2">5 facts about me!</h2>
      
<li>22 year old DMD Strategies for Business student, hoping to make a living off of designing websites, data entry/code work, producing rap music, or selling candy in the school hallways</li> 
      <p></p>
<li>Good with computers; I've been glued to a computer screen since a young age</li> 
      <p></p>
<li>Competitive gamer my entire life, from tabletop card games to MMOs and MOBAs; I played in Pokemon Trading Card Game tournaments from age 6 to 9, Yu-Gi-Oh from age 10 to 13, and I have played Magic: The Gathering competitively ever since. I've made almost $1000 playing in Magic tournaments, and after I graduate I'd like to try to make the Pro Tour</li> 
      <p></p>
<li>Self-taught socialite, can easily read body language, very good with people</li> 
      <p></p>
<li>Obsessed with all forms of rap music, from the classic 90s titans (Nas, Biggie, Pac, Wu Tang) to the modern trap-rap movement (Future, iLoveMakonnen, Gucci Mane, or basically anything produced by Metro Boomin)</li>
