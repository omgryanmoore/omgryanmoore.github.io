I'm a 22 year old Digital Media & Design student at the University of Connecticut. 
<br></br>
I'm currently studying coding languages and design software in an effort to increase my proficiency with computers.
<br></br>
I will graduate in 2016 with a Bachelor's degree and I plan to move out and build my new life from the ground up.

<b><i>Want to know more? Here's 7 quick facts about me:</b></i>
<br></br>
1. Competitive gamer since age 6; I love MOBAs and MMOs, but I specialize in card games (Magic the Gathering, Hearthstone)
<br></br>
2. Obsessed with music; Started with my parent's 70s/80s rock bands, currently fascinated by the progressive trap-rap music scene
<br></br>
3. My spirit animal is the Panda bear. Why? Because I'm 6'4", I eat way too much food, and most of my clothes are black or white
<br></br>
4. I am happiest when outdoors and I love to spend time reading & meditating at various scenic nature spots around my hometown
<br></br>
5. Avid skateboarder since age 12; Mostly vert, ramps are great, but with my increased height and weight I can't do tricks anymore
<br></br>
6. I secretly dream of donning a supervillain alter ego & producing unique, borderline-offensive trap music using the Ableton Live software
<br></br>
7. I really hope that nobody actually reads this dorky list of facts about me because I like to pretend that I'm dark and mysterious like Kanye
